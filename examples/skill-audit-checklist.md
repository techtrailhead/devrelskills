# Skills Audit Checklist

Use this to evaluate which marketing skills to use, adapt, or skip for DevRel work.

## Decision framework

For each skill, ask:

1. **Does the audience match?** Developers vs. general consumers
2. **Does the format work?** Code-first vs. copy-first
3. **Does the tone work?** Technical vs. promotional
4. **Is there a DevRel equivalent?** What would this skill look like for developers?
